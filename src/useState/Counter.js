/**
 * useState is a Hook. We call it inside a function component to add some local state to it.
 * React will preserve this state between re-renders.
 * useState returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it.
 * You can call this function from an event handler or somewhere else. Itâ€™s similar to this.setState in a class,
 * except it does not merge the old and new state together.
 * @returns {*}
 * @constructor
